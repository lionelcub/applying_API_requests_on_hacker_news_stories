The issue is that an entity with billions of dollars to protect (such as a pension fund) cannot rely on the FDIC because of the $250K insurance limit.  There are not enough banks in the US to spread billions of dollars across, $250K at a time, even if an entity was willing to manage 10&#x27;s of thousands of bank accounts.  A government bond is generally the safest alternative.  When demand for the safest level of protection is high, an entity might be willing to pay for the protection because market conditions make them unwilling to accept greater risk.

II2II,,,,20550570,"[20550871, 20551063]",20549685.0,,"There were many reasons why Hypercard died:<p>Hypercard was very much a product of it&#x27;s time.  Software was far less complex so it was much easier to create a general purpose development tool for end users.  The author argues that attempts to recreate Hypercard try to do too much, that is because users expect more of software today.  To give you an idea of what I mean: I used Hypercard to create a cookbook for a family member in the mid-1990&#x27;s.  You could enter recipes, search for recipes, and even export them to HTML.  While this would have been an amazing accomplishment a few years earlier, the program was a relic of a bygone era the moment that it was written.  Adding useful features, such as uploading those HTML files to a web server, may have been possible but would have required extensions to the language.  Plenty of extensions existed, which is how companies like Cyan managed to produce an amazing for the time multimedia game (Myst) on what most people viewed as a stack of programmable black and white index cards.  Yet extending Hypercard to reflect the technology of the 1990&#x27;s would have transformed a product for everyone to an incomprehensible mass for anyone aside from developers.  And the 1990&#x27;s were primitive compared to the 2010&#x27;s, never mind the coming 2020&#x27;s.<p>In a similar vein, people&#x27;s interests changed.  The mid-1990&#x27;s brought the web, so people were far more interested in developing for the web.  The early days of web development were quite accessible, was focused upon content (much as Hypercard was) and allowed people to embed programs within that content (much as Hypercard did).  While Hypercard may have been better for some things and certainly provided a better development environment, it was also obsolete.<p>As much as I loved Hypercard, the reality is that it was neglected rather than buried.  It&#x27;s longevity could have been improved without increasing complexity, such as adding colour or allowing multimedia files to be embedded (without resorting to third-party extensions).  On the other hand, it would have died off eventually.  The trajectory of web development shows how a once simple and accessible platform can become so complex that it takes a dedicated student to learn.",1564359265,,comment,

Prior to the hurricane their per capita output was $32,000. Comparable to Italy and South Korea. Yet few would make that comparison, in regards to quality of life, development level, et al. It&#x27;s of course an artificial inflation, with Puerto Rico getting to ride the US economy.<p>The second poorest state by output is Arkansas, at $42k. That prompts an odd situation of then comparing Arkansas versus countries with similar per capita output such as Japan, UK, France, New Zealand, etc.<p>Does Kentucky ($47k) really compare with Finland ($50k)? Or is that mostly the benefit of riding the US output machine. Some states certainly compare better with Finland, such as Massachusetts or Washington for example. Except their output levels are astronomical at $82.5k and $74k.<p>And all of that naturally opens up questions about Singapore or Australia&#x27;s output benefit re China.

One day a beggar approached Barnum in the street. Instead of giving him money, Barnum decided to employ him. Taking him back to the museum, he gave the man five bricks and told him to make a slow circuit of several blocks. At certain points he was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk, always keeping one brick in hand. On the return journey he was to replace each brick on the street with the one he held. Meanwhile he was to remain serious of countenance and to answer no questions. Once back at the museum, he was to enter, walk around then leave through the back door and make the same bricklaying circuit again.
On the man’s first walk through the streets, several hundred people watched his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit, onlookers swarmed around him, debating what he was doing. Every time he entered the museum he was followed by people who bought tickets to keep watching him. Many of them were distracted by the museum’s collections, and stayed inside. By the end of the first day, the brick man had drawn over a thousand people into the museum. &quot;",1564361108,,comment,

philwelch,,,,20550678,,20550052.0,,"I think this is more of a cultural shift than anything. Americans in particular used to be tinkerers and makers to a much greater degree. While admittedly many of these examples are influenced by gender roles, it was much more common than today for a mid-century American man to be a tinkerer and handyman who might work on his car in his own garage, do his own home maintenance, and stuff like that. HyperCard and the early days of personal computers arrived at the tail end of this era, where it seemed perfectly natural for &quot;owning a computer&quot; to naturally entail &quot;doing basic computer programming&quot; in much the same way as owning a house, car, or motorcycle entailed doing basic work that entailed having some understanding of the thing. (One complaint you hear about cars these days is that you can&#x27;t just work on them in your own garage anymore!)<p>America today is a mass consumer culture where people by and large don&#x27;t really do that kind of work. Contra Heinlein, Americans today are increasingly specialized insects, less likely to even cook their own meals let alone write a HyperCard stack to manage their recipes. It&#x27;s in the culture even more broadly than anything Apple might do.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to see Apple as making the problem worse instead of better. Apple loves hardware designs that make it impossible to take the machine apart, for instance. Steve Jobs always had that bias--compare the original Macintosh 128K to the Macintosh II, for instance. Even HyperCard itself only came out after Steve left and the hackers briefly took over. And I get it, because a platform that allows for tinkerers and dilettantes is never going to be as beautiful and elegant as a something that was thoughtfully designed from a single perspective; just think back to MySpace or Geocities. But it also makes people dumber in the practical sense of being less capable of changing, repairing, and fully comprehending the world around them.",1564361225,,comment,

I tend to look for companies that are just past the startup stage, and moving into that awkward stage where they have to scale, but everything up to this point has been based on heroic efforts of a few people.  Usually there are gaps from people who have left and as the business expands, there is a lot of greenfield work that people <i>want</i> to do and nobody left over to do the legacy work.<p>Short term contracts can get you in the door, but I would try to negotiate up into longer term contracts because legacy work is <i>slow</i>.  It&#x27;s not so much that you can&#x27;t provide a lot of value up front, but if you want long term benefits, it usually takes 2-3 years before you&#x27;ve refactored enough to make a big difference.  If going for the employee route, just keep your ears open during interviews about systems that are messy.  If you express an interest in working on those kinds of systems, it usually provokes both surprise and interest ;-)<p>I think the key for legacy work is that normally people don&#x27;t want to work on it.  There are almost always systems that people are afraid to touch -- to the point where you may even be forbidden from touching it.  However, you can often find big wins with small changes for such systems because they are usually neglected for a long time.  If you cautiously make a change and manage not to break things, then usually there is a huge pent up demand for more.<p>I think there is one other thing that I always have in mind for some reason.  In Taoist literature they frequently make the analogy that water runs to the lowest point.  In the same way, it&#x27;s easiest to make good changes in systems that are the worst.  If you are working on a very nice system, you have to spend a lot of energy staying on high ground.  But if you are working on a very poor system, you spend no energy maintaining your position at all -- you just fall into the low ground.

So the argument &quot;A clown is scarier if it exists&quot; isn&#x27;t obviously true.<p>Or put yet another way, the greatest possible mortal (existent or not) is obviously not immortal, but you could plausibly argue that the greatest possible being is.<p>If you want to maximize on one axis the most superlative <i>being</i>, though, you can probably get to God. I suspect Anselm&#x27;s conception of God is the ultimate realization of any axis of comparison we can think of: the supreme delight, the supreme fear, the most resplendent, the most hidden, etc. And in particular I think Anselm&#x27;s axis of greatness is much more defensible, that is, &quot;A being is greater if it exists&quot; sounds much more like a reasonable assumption (even if I&#x27;m not sure I accept it) than &quot;A being is scarier if it exists.&quot;",1564361676,,comment,

timv,,,,20550799,,20530484.0,,"In my experience that leads to the organisation hiring more people at the upper ranks of the management track, and the end result is that management becomes the easier path to promotion and most of your senior staff are managers, not ICs.<p>If you have a team of engineers rangining from L3-L7 (on Square&#x27;s scale), and you want to hire a new engineer you&#x27;ll interview, and then decide on a level based on the person&#x27;s skills &amp; experience. Probably you knew up front that you were targeting a 4&#x2F;5 or a 6&#x2F;7, but generally, you don&#x27;t go looking for a L7 IC, you look for an experienced engineer and then put them at the level that is appropriate.<p>But if that same team needs a manager then your policy is that they need to be a L8 or above (otherwise you&#x27;ll need to do a big reshuffle to move all the L7 ICs out). So now you interview looking for a L8+ EM, and you hire the best person you can find, and you make them a L8. Maybe they&#x27;re at the lower end of the L8 scale, and you know this role will be a stretch for them, but that&#x27;s OK because it&#x27;s good to stretch people into new roles and you think they&#x27;ll step up.<p><i>But</i>, you would have made a different decision when deciding what level to give an IC. My experience has been that for ICs, companies (rightly) err on the side of caution and if they think that the new hire is on the lower end of the scale they&#x27;ll bring them in at the lower level, and let them prove themselves.<p>So if you&#x27;re asking <i>Is this engineer a N or (N+1)?</i> you&#x27;ll be more likely to bring them in at N. But for a manager, there are incentives to bring them in at N+1 so that they can maange the members of the team who are N.<p>And now your standards for an (N+1) IC are higher than your standards for (N+1) EM. And when it comes to promotion time, the new hires form part of the benchmark. And your existing Level-N EMs are performing just as well as your new N+1 EMs, so they&#x27;re good candidates for promotion. But your existing Level-N ICs are really only performing at the same level as your new Level-N ICs, so things seem to be balanced.<p>I don&#x27;t think there are any easy solutions to this problem. If you have a policy of ICs reporting to higher-leveled EMs then you create a system that makes it easier to be promoted on the management track. But if you have ICs reporting to a same-(or lower)-leveled manager, then you have a perception (and possibly an reality) that being a manager gives you more organisational power than the same level IC.",1564363157,,comment,

adventured,,,,20550859,[20552082],20550619.0,,"I don&#x27;t think I have the wrong idea. Obviously Kentucky doesn&#x27;t have the healthcare system of France, Sweden, Finland, et al. And it doesn&#x27;t have the overall top tier welfare state system of Finland. This is understood by everyone on this forum.<p>Even if you gave Kentucky universal healthcare and pumped up the social safety net, I think it would take a lot more than that to match the overall quality of life that a Finland offers. That includes everything from culture to architecture to crime &#x2F; murder. The same is true of other elite outcome nations like Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark. Maybe Kentucky could develop that given time, or maybe it remains a Greece, Portugal, Hungary or Bulgaria of the US, a lower tier economy state vs the elite outcome states. The poorer nations of Europe usually have normal, functioning welfare states, free education and universal healthcare; it doesn&#x27;t by itself do much to put them up with the better economies, as so much more goes into it. There&#x27;s a strong argument that the geographic nature of Kentucky alone might be enough to permanently trap it in a lower tier condition.<p>My argument is that the only reason relatively backwards states like Arkansas have GDP per capita figures like France and the UK (preposterous on the surface), is because they&#x27;re heavily free riding on the immense output condition of the US as a whole. I think it&#x27;s quite obviously true.<p>The US has a homelessness and poverty rate like Canada. It has free healthcare for the bottom 25%. It spends as much on its welfare state as a share of its economy as Australia and Canada (and rising). Most of its $7.x trillion in government spending goes to welfare state programs &#x2F; social safety nets of one sort or another. None of that properly explains why Arkansas can have the output per capita of the UK or Japan. The only thing that explains it well, is Arkansas gets to ride the US $62,500 GDP per capita figure (they perform at a subpar level, so their per capita output is 1&#x2F;3 lower than the national figure). They get innumerable benefits from being part of the US, in terms of the USD standard, smooth national cross border trade, energy supply, military protection, federal subsidies, and so on. Kentucky for example is the third most dependent state when it comes to federal money. Those are pretty huge system benefits that few countries will ever get to experience.<p>What you de facto have, is states like Washington, California, Illinois, Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, Texas, Colorado, et al. heavily carrying states like Kentucky or Arkansas. If you&#x27;re in Europe, and you&#x27;re N.Macedonia, Ukraine or Serbia, Germany is not doing very much at all to carry you by comparison. And if you&#x27;re Bulgaria, Hungary, or Croatia within the EU, the same is still true, only to a lesser extent (which partially explains the huge gap in economic output &amp; development between EU nations, far larger than the gap between between US states; Bulgaria has been a member of the EU since 2007, yet their per capita output has barely climbed since 2008, ie hasn&#x27;t narrowed with the far wealthier nations; the same is true of Hungary, they&#x27;ve seen very little net improvement or narrowing since 2004&#x2F;2005). US states by comparison have it exceptionally good when it comes to the way they get to ride the overall US economy and its various perks.<p>Without being part of the US system, I think you&#x27;d see a far more dramatic divergence of outcomes among US states. You&#x27;d get the nations of Arkansas or Kentucky with a GDP per capita of $10,000 or $15,000, in the same manner you see that type of large divergence in outcomes in eg Europe and Asia.",1564364074,,comment,

neilv,,,,20550889,[20552093],20546906.0,,"Suggestions:<p>1. More requirements helps.  What <i>kinds</i> of production-grade software?<p>2. For most purposes, you won&#x27;t see the real benefits, compared to contemporary alternatives, until you have some experience with the Lisp.  Enough experience that you realize that, although you can write in a Python or Ruby style in a Lisp, to some degree, there&#x27;s other various idiomatic programming that&#x27;s a bigger win sometimes.<p>3. Once you have some reasonable level of experience, (I&#x27;ll assert) there&#x27;s a good chance you become more productive than you would be with a comparable amount of experience in most non-Lisps, <i>in general</i>.  But there are some big exceptions to that, such as if you need to do something that can be solved with an off-the-shelf library that&#x27;s already easily available in Python (e.g., a wealth of ML stuff), for example, and you&#x27;d have to write that or an interface for it in your Lisp.  Writing it yourself often means you understand it better, and can make it do exactly what you need (including possibly big advantages), but it&#x27;s an investment.<p>4. Pick a language and a particular implementation.  and make an active user community of that implementation one of the requirements.  One of the advantages of Lisps is that they tend to have great communities, perhaps because there&#x27;s usually little money in it, so you get high-powered people who are there for the merits of it, with a lot less noise.  But you do want to find one that&#x27;s being actively maintained&#x2F;developed, and that has an active user community.<p>5. Beware that most development hiring right now seems very driven by fashion, &quot;culture fit&quot;, and keywords -- a lot less hiring for &quot;smart, and background they can draw upon to pick up whatever new&#x2F;other thing is needed&quot;.  So if you get stereotyped as a &quot;Lisp person&quot;, or you don&#x27;t have one of this year&#x27;s hot stack keywords on your resume, your next job search might be surprisingly difficult.  To a large extent, if you used unfashionable keywords, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you single-handedly had major accomplishments that would normally be extremely impressive to employers.  There are very few Lisp jobs, and there have been very few for a long time.  There&#x27;s a niche for CL, but also a wealth of CL gurus already existing that you have to compete with.  There&#x27;s almost no paying work in Scheme, unless you already have the non-Scheme-specific job and can then pick your tools (i.e, professor, startup, or unusual corporate latitude).[1]  If you want to move to a Lisp, but might have to job-hunt in a couple years, Clojure might be the best bet, in that regard, at the moment.<p>[1] For years, AFAIK, I might&#x27;ve been the world&#x27;s only consultant specializing in Scheme.  But I&#x27;m shutting down my business, because there still seem to be only a handful of funded projects using it, outside academia (for university consulting, you need a rare PI and situation, for this to be good) and government (federal subcontractor overhead is a huge burden). Most of the few commercial projects using Scheme are one-person, and don&#x27;t need anyone else.<p>(Background: I&#x27;ve done serious production work in Scheme for several years, on some important Web server and cloud technical data science stuff.  I also played a very small part in a major project in Common Lisp, using SBCL, and bumped into a bit of CL at another job.  And lots of production and research work in C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, etc. separate from that.)",1564364605,,comment,

Electric cars are still deeply strangled by two key factors: industry inertia and the cost&#x2F;supply of lithium batteries. Once those two factors are solved (and a build-up of lithium mines is key to that) electric cars will go from being a niche within a niche to utterly dominating the market very, very quickly.<p>Within the next decade we might see companies like Hyundai&#x2F;Kia, Toyota and Honda selling more EVs than ICE. Take the Kia Niro EV as an example: if the cost of batteries halved and the supply was unconstrained, there is little stopping that kind of product from dominating the market—starting with two-car households with off-street parking.<p>With their lithium cell investments, Telsa are well positioned to benefit from this boom, but they need to think carefully about their positioning. Right now they&#x27;re a luxury brand with no serious competitors; when Telsa&#x27;s drivetrain advantage is substantially neutralised, their mind share is likely to stagnate.<p>In my opinion Tesla needs to prepare to be in the budget space. They need to partner with an external manufacturer to sell a product with normal door handles that competes with Hyundai and Toyota. Because once the cost of batteries falls, I predict a substantial slice of their market will simply disappear to the economy manufacturers.

gregmac,,,,20551166,[20551713],20550896.0,,"&gt; Packages being months behind the latest version is a feature, not a bug — it means things will only be randomly changing under your feet rarely, with the exception of security fixes.<p>If things are &quot;randomly changing&quot; by updates, that means the upstream package isn&#x27;t following semantic versioning practices, and more importantly, isn&#x27;t preserving backwards compatibility with their releases. That&#x27;s a mark of bad software development practices, and it also isn&#x27;t solved by an arbitrary wait period: that just means months after the breaking change is done, you finally notice and complain, but most maintainers are going to (rightfully) ignore you by that point.<p>I&#x27;d make the same argument in general software quality: with new features, often come new bugs, so by delaying, you can delay introduction of those bugs. However, bugs are easier to fix the sooner they&#x27;re found, so again, quick turn-around improves things, even if it sometimes causes short-term pain.<p>This is one thing where NPM is definitely miles ahead of APT. With APT, you get a single version of each package, so it&#x27;s all or nothing. With NPM, you can specify `1.1.x` so even if a version 1.2 or 2.0 comes out, you&#x27;re on the stable old one. The closest thing that seems to happen with linux packaging is on a major version (with backwards-incompatible changes) a new package name is created with a &quot;2&quot; on the end, to signal this incompatibility -- how is that anything but a hacky workaround to not having proper versioning support?",1564368595,,comment,

Down 60 pounds, so much more energy it&#x27;s hard to describe the difference. I make the whole walk now in 30 minutes easily maintaining four mph up hills and down, and I could hold a conversation while doing it and not sound out of breath.

For instance, the sort function that relies only on less-than operations defines two values as equal if neither value is less than the other. Many people consider this weird, and wonder why sort doesn’t require both less-than and equality operations. The spaceship operator essentially implements a group of operations, and guarantees they’ll be consistent: less-than, equal, and greater-than (plus not-equal, less-than-or-equal, and greater-than-or-equal).

The argument isn&#x27;t that guns make you safer, it&#x27;s that they give you the ability to defend yourself if you are already in an unsafe situation. On average, most people will never be in a situation where they need to defend themselves, thus getting a gun will increase their risk of a self-inflicted wound. Accidents of all kind (not just guns) are much more frequent than violent altercations. But the crux of the matter is not that, the question that needs answering is &quot;If you are already in a situation where your life is at risk from another human being, does having a gun make it better or worse?&quot; We don&#x27;t actually know the answer to that question, since statistics on defensive usage of guns are pretty bad.<p>Another point to make is that there&#x27;s an undercurrent of personal responsibility. The danger presented by having a gun in your home is something that can be managed if you are a responsible gun owner, but the risk of violence against your self is not something you can easily control. This is the important part, owning a gun for self defense is not about making you safer, it&#x27;s about transferring the risk from something you have no control over to something you have some measure of control over.<p>Thus, arguing that owning guns increase your risk of dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wounds holds no weight with people who want to own guns, since it&#x27;s a fundamental misunderstanding of why one would want to own a gun for self defense.",1564371296,,comment,

  - be an easy sell to businesses
</code></pre>
Clojure checks every single bullet point on that list; it<p><pre><code>  - is *the most modern* Lisp that&#x27;s designed from ground up (no historical baggage&#x2F;cruft)
  - is hosted on *the Java platform* (i.e., &quot;the Java world&quot;), which is so far the most robust enterprise software ecosystem. This means that you have access to the most robust package management system (Leiningen&#x2F;Maven), the most battle-tested and production-quality libraries, and the most powerful development tools (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA), and etc.
  - is created by a pragmatic&#x2F;practical guy who wants to build production-ready software. It&#x27;s not the result of an academic research&#x2F;experiment&#x2F;thesis.
  - is the result of a trade-off that makes it an easier sell to businesses. Businesses tend to be more conservative when it comes to choosing a platform to invest on and usually prefer the ones that are battle-tested, well-established, and well-supported. As of right now, it&#x27;s the Java platform. No other enterprise software ecosystem can hold a candle to it.

However, it <i>is</i> a commercial product, and not free (but not as expensive as some other commercial development tools).<p>For a free CL, SBCL is very good. However it&#x27;s a very &quot;classic&quot; kind of a language, with just text mode tools and a unix bias.<p>For a non-CL Lisp-like, Racket is fun, but their debugging story is not my favorite. But pragmatically speaking, Clojure is probably the better choice. It is based in the Java Runtime, so things don&#x27;t work <i>exactly</i> like they would in a normal Lisp, but in exchange you get great interop with a ton of Java libraries and tools, which I think is a net positive.<p>That said, Franz ACL would still be my tool of choice, if non-free is not a deal-breaker. :)",1564372081,,comment,

Both in traditional breeding as well as with genetic engineering, you have to have sufficient number of trials to conclude anything.<p>With Human subjects, given ethical and practical constraints (lifespan), that&#x27;s going to be a lot tougher.<p>You can reliably quantify the intelligence of a mouse at a few weeks of age and breed it soon thereafter (though you would probably use that &quot;IQ&quot; to score its parents). You can&#x27;t reliably quantify health and intelligence of a Human within years, especially if you are aiming for &quot;multiple standard deviations&quot; above average.

temporaryvector,,,,20551417,,20551072.0,,"It&#x27;s interesting to me that you bring up abortion, since to me, as an outsider (I&#x27;m not from the US), the mainstream US debates about abortion and about guns have a lot of parallels. The &quot;against&quot; side tends to paint their proposals as &quot;reasonable, common-sense regulations&quot; but their more extreme arguments tend to be full of misinformation, misunderstandings and emotional pleas to the sanctity of life. On the other hand, the &quot;pro&quot; side either believes that all those &quot;reasonable regulations&quot; are just a transparent attempt by the other side to get their foot in the door, to move the overton window a little bit, so they can enact harsher regulations later, or that those regulations are not reasonable at all and will never be implement correctly.<p>For example, whenever the pro-choice side hears someone from the other side propose regulations about requiring permits for clinics that perform abortions (something that in principle they might agree to), they fear that the person proposing the regulations isn&#x27;t really pro-choice but only says that because outright banning abortion would not be politically feasible, thus they fear (rightfully so, since it has happened) those regulations will be so onerous or badly implemented that it will result in a de-facto ban on abortion, maybe those permits will be very hard to get or maybe the organization handing them out will be understaffed and underfunded (or both). Similarly, whenever someone who is pro-guns hears someone talking about mental health checks before owning guns (also something they might agree with in principle), for example, what they fear is that this system will be abused to deprive as many individuals as possible of their rights without due process.<p>Thus, in this situation, neither debate will move forward because pro side does not believe that the anti side is proposing any legislation in good faith, and the reason they believe so is that in many cases that has blatantly been the case, leading to farther spreading of the divide.<p>Additionally, as you say, someone might be both pro-choice and pro-guns but the political situation is such that they have to choose one or the other, and thus they choose the one they hold dearer to them, usually one that affects them more personally. Unfortunately for the pro-choice crowd, gun control laws seem to personally affect more people in the US than abortion laws.",1564372867,,comment,

Jach,,,,20551467,,20546906.0,,"The existence proofs for production code for both Clojure and Common Lisp have been done. That is, large teams, large programs, and making money. I&#x27;d point you towards either one.<p>Both have &quot;modern&quot; toolchains, testing and CI support, etc., depending exactly on what you mean by that. I suggest whatever you pick to spend some time trying out a few different workflows though (some of which may hail from before you were born yet still feel great) rather than deciding something based on what seems &quot;modern&quot; from your past experience. There was a time when Clojure was &quot;just another jar&quot; to sneak into an enterprise Java app and introduce a bit of sanity. It wasn&#x27;t &quot;modern&quot; then, lein didn&#x27;t even exist, but it was still worth doing for a lot of people. Similarly there&#x27;s a lot of CL code out there that just chucks stuff into a single script-like file instead of doing things &quot;the correct&quot; way (the author might even expect you to use e.g. SBCL with the --script flag, which will do something very similar to what Python does when you pass a filename to it instead of launching it on its own), just like a lot of Python code out there chucked into a single file, but it can still be useful and perhaps appropriate for a particular production task.<p>For CL I&#x27;ve recommended this booklet before: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darkchestnut.com&#x2F;book-common-lisp-application-deployment&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darkchestnut.com&#x2F;book-common-lisp-application-de...</a> It helps you quickly get setup into one (of many possible) modern-feeling professional flows (by Java standards at least, which you&#x27;ll also find following the default lein flow on the Clojure side) with a suggested project layout, a version-pinned library-dependencies definition file, and a single-step source-to-exe process via a simple Makefile that&#x27;s little more than a wrapper around a simple shell script which would expose functions like all() or clean() as commands.<p>To add a bit more after reading some other replies, it&#x27;s notable that Common Lisp has multiple implementations to choose from (some open source, some not) and if you&#x27;re following the ANSI standard (or using various trivial-x or de-facto standard libraries) they can all run your code so you can change implementations rather easily later on if you have a reason to. (There&#x27;s also an implementation that works well when you need to integrate with C++, and of course a JVM implementation if you do decide you want something in that ecosystem.) Clojure has no standard, it is whatever the on-JVM implementation implements, which has in the past changed and may change again (though the creator has ranted against doing that in general, we&#x27;ll see if usage of &quot;spec&quot; can continue without changes though) and alter your program&#x27;s behavior. There&#x27;s a popular on-JS implementation (if you&#x27;re looking to write production front-end app code I&#x27;d highly recommend getting into ClojureScript over any other Lisp) and a less popular on-.NET implementation, they&#x27;ll both for the most part run pure Clojure code, but there are a lot of non-portable bits.",1564373724,,comment,

If I&#x27;m a small business, and I need a custom (in-house) app, AND I could do it myself with little training, I&#x27;d rather do that then not have the business.<p>The first company I worked for developed such a system and it worked out very well for them. You would write your UI in XML and your business logic as Postgres stored procedures using either PLPGSQL or any number of other languages with Postgres bindings. They then had a C frontend which would parse the XML and render out the UI using either GTK or HTML. It also had the ability to make arbitrary HTTP requests which allowed for some pretty sophisticated integrations.<p>Everything about this felt wrong yet it allowed the company to rapidly deliver new functionality and bespoke customizations, on site and often in a matter of hours. It was also simple to the point they could train others in the business (outside of development) to use it.",1564374102,,comment,

asimilator,,,,20551598,[20551966],20551129.0,,"Every time one of these articles about Emacs is posted here I kind of shake my head and wonder why my experience with it is so different.<p>So big caveat: my experience with Emacs is pretty much entirely limited to org-mode (which is the only reason I picked up Emacs at all). I really liked a lot of the ideas in org-mode, but the more I used it the more I really wanted to make some minor tweaks. No problem, I thought. Emacs is famous for being super customizable. But everything I touched was extremely brittle, and essentially impossible to configure to work as I wanted it to.<p>1. Wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of &quot;\star&quot; &quot;\star\star&quot; &quot;\star\star\star&quot; as the headlines. I would prefer &quot;\t\star&quot; &quot;\t\t\star&quot; &quot;\t\t\t\star&quot;. Hmm, seems the only way to do this is a hack that changes the leading stars to the same color as my Emacs background. That&#x27;s kind of hack-y. The rationale I could find for this was to keep a consistent on disk format. I guess that makes sense, though it&#x27;s not something I care about ... I don&#x27;t intend on sharing my TODO list (and my understanding is there&#x27;s no 100% compatible org-mode parser outside of Emacs anyway). Not a big deal, I&#x27;ll live with it.<p>2. Agenda view. As I started using org-mode more and more for task management I decided I needed a good task view. I set my own task and project states (nice: simple, works) then I set to work on creating a nice view of all my tasks organized in separate sections (REFILE tasks, active projects, active tasks). Hmm, now it takes multiple seconds to refresh my agenda view. And I have to manually refresh it any time I make a change to any file ... This kinda sucks. Might be a solution for this, never got around to investigating.<p>3. File structure for my org files. Despite the occasional org-mode article on Hacker News, it&#x27;s actually pretty hard to find good examples of a full org-mode workflow. When I was actively working on this I found one or two. When writing my org files I kept running in to the odd problem with certain features because of how I was laying out my files. Should there be an empty line after a headline? Are paragraphs separated by empty lines? If you don&#x27;t do this correctly (and since there&#x27;s so few examples available, &quot;correctly&quot; is something you have to figure out by trial and error) then certain exporters (pdf, html) don&#x27;t give correct output, or folding doesn&#x27;t work.<p>4. Directory structure of my org files repo. I like being aggressive about breaking things up in to different files. And then organizing these files in to different directories. New project? New directory, new project org file. Let&#x27;s make a separate file for research. So &lt;PROJECT DIR&gt;&#x2F;Research.org. Unfortunately this butts up with how org-mode assumes you have things organized (which again, you can only really figure out by trial and error when things don&#x27;t work). Take REFILE for example. It tab completes by file name. But problematically I now have a lot of files with similar names (e.g. Research.org) in different directories. org-refile-use-outline-path sort of fixes this but it&#x27;s still clunky.<p>5. Emphasis. The straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back. All of the above were minor and I kept with org-mode. It sorta worked. But I was annoyed. Eventually I started doing some research that involved quotes where I really wanted to basically highlight phrases or sentences that were important. I figured this would either be built-in to org-mode or easily added in my Emacs conf. I never did find a solution that actually worked. I can underline, italicize, bold, etc, but no highlight (i.e. classic yellow background for text). Apparently org-mode deliberately prevents the end user from adding their own custom emphasis formats in order to have a consistent file format.<p>At this point I left org-mode and emacs all together and ended up writing my own rich text editor so I could do whatever formatting I wanted. It doesn&#x27;t do 1% of what org-mode can, but dammit I can highlight in 6 different colors.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed I never got to experience the Emacs nirvana that all these articles describe. Maybe it&#x27;s just org-mode, but everything I touched seemed extremely brittle. Felt very much like I was forced to do it the org-mode way. It was really disappointing.",1564375846,,comment,

indexinvestoreu,,,,20551848,,20546513.0,,"&gt; The main assumption is that one can expect to have a 6-7% return by investing in good ETFs. I have researched a little bit and I don&#x27;t see how that can be achieved investing in the European bonds&#x2F;stocks.<p>A reasonable investment strategy involving ETFs will involve investing in companies throughout the whole world. Not just European companies or US companies. 
Ideally you want to have an investment strategy that maximizes return for your risk profile. That strategy is independent of where you live.
There are S&amp;P 500 ETFs in the US and there are S&amp;P 500 ETFs in the EU (try googling for &quot;S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF&quot;).<p>&gt; At the moment the safest bet seems to park money in monetary&#x2F;government bonds that however don&#x27;t return more than 1.5% on average.
The &quot;good ETFs&quot; you mentioned that have a 6-7% return are anything but safe. They aren&#x27;t as &quot;safe&quot; as bonds. the &quot;good ETFs&quot; you mentioned likely invest in companies, the stock market has a high degree of risk and volatility. That is fine in the sense that with greater risk comes greater reward. You should just keep in mind that if you want something safe you shouldn&#x27;t be looking at anything that invests in equities.<p>&gt; Can somebody provide some suggestion references about good investment strategies with a low risk profile in an european context?

Claims on infinite sets can only be supported by rules of inference valid for the set.<p>2. We do not have rules of inference for reality.<p>I was listening to some debate over the weekend where someone claimed science can only tell us what is false and not what is true. But this is a massive misunderstanding of falsifyability as a criteria for demarcation between science and non science.<p>If we use the word real for what is in the science side of the demarcation line...<p>Then, without rules of inference (which again we, any claim about what is real  can only be said to be true or false if it is backed up by an actual measurement. So if I say all dogs have 4 legs, I can only defend it as true if I test it against the set of all dogs, the first dog that does not have 4 legs though would make further testing less useful, maybe you want to check some more dogs to make sure you are not testing wrong, but once exception to a claim on an infinite set makes the claim invalid. Or as popper would say, it falsifies the claim.<p>So for any dog, we cannot say for sure if it has 4 legs or if it does not have 4 legs if we don&#x27;t measure it. We cannot say the claim that it has 4 legs is true or false before we measure it.<p>So science does not tell us what is false. It tells us that claims about infinite sets of things which are real cannot be said to valid, because we don&#x27;t have rules of inference, and while they may be valid we should try our best to find exceptions to these claims so that we do not keep on relying on them if they are not valid.",1564380910,,comment,

Here you typically implement “compare” which is equivalent to the spaceship operator and get &lt; &amp;c for free, but you can implement “&lt;=“ and get compare for free because the defaulting mechanism is general and not built into the compiler. Also “Ord” has to be compatible with “Eq” (which you can also get for free) which is different from C++’s approach. Moreover, the compiler can “derive” implementations for regular data objects.<p>C# is slightly different: all of the algorithms take an IComparison, which implements the spaceship operator in another class (you can implement the related IComparer in your actual class and it all works via the magic of reflection. This isn&#x27;t too bad since the reflection only occurs in the constructor.).

Jared Diamond talks about this in &quot;Collapse&quot;:<p>&quot;consider a narrow river valley below a high dam, such that if the dam burst, the resulting flood of water would drown people for a considerable distance downstream. When attitude pollsters ask people downstream of the dam how concerned they are about the dam&#x27;s bursting, it&#x27;s not surprising that fear of a dam burst is lowest far downstream, and increases among residents increasingly close to the dam. Surprisingly, though, after you get just a few miles below the dam, where fear of the dam&#x27;s breaking is found to be highest, concern then falls off to zero as you approach closer to the dam! That is, the people living immediately under the dam, the ones most certain to be drowned in a dam burst, profess unconcern. That&#x27;s because of psychological denial: the only way of preserving one&#x27;s sanity while looking up every day at the dam is to deny the possiblity that it could burst. &quot;

They are essentially lead-acid with a tad more energy density and being very sensitive about how they&#x27;re charged.<p>NiMH don&#x27;t have that great of a capacity at maximum rated discharge but they do have a very very low internal resistance while still (almost) matching Lithium batteries in energy density. Additionally, they are almost perfectly constant voltage until discharged, making them suitable for applications where you might not want a complicated voltage controller.<p>Lithium is actually a fairly difficult cell. Drawing maximum discharge will reduce capacity, they don&#x27;t like shocks or extreme temperatures and their voltage stability is <i>meh</i> at best. They also heat up a lot when charging or discharging, making cooling circuits required in some scenarios.

You just need to learn how to double-check your work and figure out where you went wrong.  This is a skill that everyone doing nontrivial math has to learn.  In a formal learning environment, you constantly get feedback on your mistakes through the grading process, which you obviously don&#x27;t get when self-learning.  My advice is to work the example problems before looking at the solution.  After you have worked it yourself, you can then easily see where you went wrong.  You should also get books of solved problems that let you practice this more extensively.  There are problem books for pretty much every undergrad math topic as well as some grad-level ones.  A lot of textbooks even have solution manuals that will show you how to solve the end-of-chapter problems in the textbook.

It puts a puff of cesium atoms into a state which is as controlled as is possible and then finds the microwave frequency that causes the largest number of atoms to change state. The second is currently defined as a multiple of the period of the microwave signal that, under specified conditions, induces that particular transition in cesium.<p>The up and down motion itself doesn&#x27;t result in the time measurement.<p>The purpose of the &#x27;thrown ball&#x27; in F1 is so that the atoms being measured are in freefall during their measurement which eliminates uncertanties in the measurement which would otherwise come from forces confining them and to keep them in that unperturbed state for as long as possible. By using a very long interaction (technically two interactions separated by a long time, a form of interferometery) the peak response can be made very narrow which allows for a more precise measurement.<p>F1&#x27;s frequency is used to tune continuously running highly stable oscillators (or, really, measure their offsets so that they can be corrected in post-processing without being disturbed by frequent tuning).<p>The combination of a continuous stable oscillator and a counter gives you something you&#x27;d recognize as a clock.

People who joined the group are self selecting as having had some sort of problem or concern to discuss.<p>And that&#x27;s almost all I could find on the topic. The only other thing that seemed notable is that the brains of transgender people resemble those of their chosen sex, not their birth sex. I.e. a MTF person had a brain typical of a women, not a man. But, this difference may only appear in adulthood, so it isn&#x27;t clear if it is physiological or social.<p>If someone wanted to investigate this, investigating the testicular and endocrinal health of MTF people before transition would be a good start. If endocrine disruption had anything to do with it you would expect to see much more testicular cancer. The DES group had 5 out of 500 with this cancer, incidentally, while having a low cancer incidence overall.<p>I would categorize the published research on this topic as extremely slim.

A different set of verticals, regulations to work with. A different amount of platforms or hardware (quantum computers, more accessible VR&#x2F;AR).<p>Take for example the current situation with agri-tech (vertical), it&#x27;s pretty boring because it doesn&#x27;t pay as much as putting different colored boxes in web pages for advertisers. With that vertical, you also have to take in localization for a region. Agri-tech vertical is nowhere near &quot;tech-saturated&quot; in other parts of the world. Random thought: it wouldn&#x27;t be far-fetched to say agri-tech would pay a ton more if global warming went crazier in 10-20 years.<p>In 10 years, we can get better tooling, but if regional regulations&#x2F;laws hamper new tech, we&#x27;ll see tech-startups develop for that specific region. Things like data privacy laws in other countries would lessen usage of public clouds and more in-house data centers. Trade-wars also spawn events like Github&#x2F;Google blocking developers based in other countries, etc. So you&#x27;ll see more startups taking advantage of that by developing localized tooling leveraging regulations and laws.<p>Take for example, Alibaba. 10 years ago (~2009), you wouldn&#x27;t know about that company unless you&#x27;re from China. Now they&#x27;re the Amazon&#x2F;Google for a closed-economy of more than a billion people, more than twice the population of US. Grab, Paytm, Line are just getting started. So we&#x27;ll probably saturate in 20-30 years?

Sharing your calendar with Google Calendar, Outlook or similar also allows you to select which type of data you wanna share.<p>Or being able to set a repeat of any item, not just a class. So you can create for example a repeating quiz grading over several weeks.<p>There are more, smaller differences like you can enter extra-curricular events that to not belong to any course. Or have an attendance tracking where you can skip single classes and see an overview of skipped ones..",1564386151,,comment,

As in &lt;user&gt;&#x2F;&lt;project&gt; or &lt;group&gt;&#x2F;project&gt;.<p>&gt; Then, assume that the most flexible option is for each gem to be owned by a unique group: that way even if two gems are maintained by the same users right now, they use two distinct groups in case that ownership changes in the future.<p>&gt; We might as well just name the “group” the same as the gem name, since only one gem is managed by each group. So now the “purescript” group maintains “purescript”, the “pry” group maintains “pry”, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t agree -- even if it&#x27;s always group-a&#x2F;purescript I think the distinction is still important, because in this case previous-group&#x2F;puresecript <i>still exists</i>, but is frozen&#x2F;archived. Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;m understanding the scenario you laid out:<p>1. group-a&#x2F;purescript is created<p>2. purescript changes ownership, group-b is going to be publishing it going forward<p>3. group-b&#x2F;purescript is created<p>4. group-a&#x2F;purescript freezes&#x2F;archives&#x2F;deprecates itself<p>5. group-b&#x2F;purescript is actively developed<p>The fact that &quot;group-b&quot; is the &quot;right&quot; purescript is arbitrary&#x2F;subjective to some degree.<p>&gt; I think there’s a pretty compelling case that package managers should support group ACLing on publishing (giving multiple humans the first-class right to publish using individual creds to a group namespace, with the ability to add&#x2F;remove users from the group over time. But once you’ve done that, the distinction between explicit group-name-in-package-path and changing-name-to-fork (so the difference between fork-group&#x2F;orig-name and orig-name_fork-group) seems to shrink.<p>I think these two issues are a bit separate. Letting people dynamically change who owns&#x2F;can publish to a repository is <i>one way</i> to solve this problem, but I think it&#x27;s more complex than the fork-and-move approach.<p>IMO if some user wants to give up&#x2F;transfer their repo, they:<p>1. find someone else to take over if they want<p>2. freeze&#x2F;archive&#x2F;whatever their repo<p>3. let the person fork &amp; continue their work<p>An ownership change <i>should</i> be opt in, unless it was known @ package creation time that ownership would be a shared&#x2F;rotated&#x2F;changing&#x2F;nebulous thing (which would be demonstrated by a group owning the package from the beginning).",1564388825,,comment,

repolfx,,,,20552571,,20549752.0,,"Like I said, it can take some thought and analysis to discern the underlying logic. Still, I tend to think that even though of course not everything is 100% logical in politics, it&#x27;s more logical than it may first appear.<p><i>&quot;how can you be against the death penalty, but pro-abortion&quot;</i><p>People who are pro-abortion don&#x27;t consider it to be murder, but rather just a normal medical operation done for the benefit of the mother. Whereas the death penalty - or really any harsh punishments at all - is perceived as being &quot;nasty&quot;, brutish, uncivilised etc.<p><i>compare LGBT support on the left today, with their persecution under most communist governments in the past</i><p>Putting my flame-retardant suit on for a moment, the reality is that if you scratch the surface, the left hasn&#x27;t changed at all in this regard.<p>A key tenant of leftist intuition is that the world can be perceived through the lens of identity group oppressions. It&#x27;s always been this way since Marx: he was obsessed with the perceived bourgeoisie oppression of the proletariat (capitalists vs the working class). Hence communists being so frequently anti-semitic, as Marx perceived Jews as being intrinsically bourgeoisie.<p>Now LGBT oppression wasn&#x27;t a communist thing - <i>all</i> societies considered homosexuality to be taboo up until incredibly recently, it&#x27;s been one of societies most stable taboos - most likely due to higher STD rates amongst homosexuals, and inability to create a family. That was a much bigger deal in times before state pensions, when children were the primary way to be supported in old age.<p>The switch then is simple enough - the modern left is obsessed with the perceived oppression of LGBT by white middle aged men. The important thing is not <i>exactly</i> which group is being oppressed by which other group; the important thing is that oppression is happening and must be stopped. The fall of the USSR and rise of Chinese manufacturing did huge damage to the idea of capitalists vs the working class being the fundamental division in society. The disappearance of the taboo against homosexuality as STD rates fell and social security rose, caused the old division to be seamlessly replaced with &quot;white men vs women and minorities&quot;. Same old, same old.<p><i>the Christian US right that mostly ignores Jesus&#x27; rather socialist teachings, while the mostly non-Christian left is in a hurry to bring them up</i><p>Interesting example. I&#x27;ve not thought of Jesus as a socialist before. If you mean &quot;love thy neighbour&quot;, that&#x27;s not socialism, that&#x27;s old fashioned charity - and conservatives generally give more to charity, if I recall studies correctly. Or which things said by Jesus do you mean?<p><i>Unions used to be (still are?) anti-immigration, and kind of a left-wing thing?, while the left is pro-immigration</i><p>Unions represent the &#x27;old left&#x27; and must do structurally, because their goal is to represent the financial interests of their members: blue collar labour, mostly. But this doesn&#x27;t always hold true. Unions in the UK financially support Labour, which is stuffed with pro-EU MPs and which just came out in favour of a second referendum (i.e. trying to cancel Brexit). Given the choice, they preferred to support mass immigration of low wage workers, than be ideologically disloyal.<p>The idea of immigration as inherently positive is a somewhat recent development. Marx had nothing to say on the topic and actual communist states only ever had problems stopping people leaving, not arriving. However we can see that it&#x27;s plenty logical from a perspective of moral reasoning without regard to costs - poor people live in poor countries where wages are low. We don&#x27;t know how to make wages rise in those countries but if they come here their wages&#x2F;standard of living will go up a lot automatically. So it&#x27;s immoral to stop people coming here and benefiting that way.<p><i>Environmentalism and animal welfare were right-wing positions in Nazi Germany</i><p>Left and right have got completely messed up in any discussion of the third Reich. We&#x27;re told by academics that Nazi Germany was far right, but this doesn&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny. Consider how many similarities there are between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin (who was uncontroversially ultra-hard left). Both hated jews. Both put people in concentration camps. Both explicitly expansionist. Both obsessed with identity politics (racial for Hitler, class based for Lenin). Both dictatorships with no love of democracy.

At first glance, they allow multiple authors to claim names like http, but that simply means that people will need to refer to those packages as wycats&#x27; http or reem&#x27;s http, offering little benefit over package names like wycats-http or reem-http.<p>&gt; When we looked at package ecosystems without namespacing, we found that people tended to go with more creative names (like nokogiri instead of “tenderlove’s libxml2”). These creative names tend to be short and memorable, in part because of the lack of any hierarchy. They make it easier to communicate concisely and unambiguously about packages. They create exciting brands. And we’ve seen the success of several 10,000+ package ecosystems like NPM and RubyGems whose communities are prospering within a single namespace.<p>&gt; In short, we don’t think the Cargo ecosystem would be better off if Piston chose a name like bvssvni&#x2F;game-engine (allowing other users to choose wycats&#x2F;game-engine) instead of simply piston.<p>&gt; Because namespaces are strictly more complicated in a number of ways,and because they can be added compatibly in the future should they become necessary, we’re going to stick with a single shared namespace.",1564389116,,comment,

By adding a highly reflective mirror on the back of a photovoltaic cell, they broke efficiency records<p>&gt; &quot;What the mirror does is create a dense infrared luminescent photon gas within the solar cell, a phenomenon that adds voltage,&quot; said Yablonovitch<p>&gt; Recently, his team recognized that this mirror could serve double duty. In fact, it solves one of the biggest challenges in thermophotovoltaics: how to exploit the thermal (heat) photons that have too little energy to produce electricity. It turns out that the mirror can reflect those small photons to reheat the thermal source, providing a second chance for a high energy photon to be created and generate electricity. This phenomenon leads to unprecedented efficiency.<p>Given these paragraphs and the name &quot;thermophotovoltalics&quot;, that this is about solar power seems like a reasonable conclusion to draw. Also, googling around I am seeing figures for steam turbine efficiency of between 40 and 80%. How sure are you this is not about solar cells?",1564389206,,comment,

I’m saying that given the “right” version is arbitrary and subjective, the difference between “group-b&#x2F;purescript” and “purescript-group-b” is effectively nil. More concretely: if namespacing existed, you could fork “group-a&#x2F;purescript” to “group-b&#x2F;purescript”, but if namespacing didn’t, you could fork “purescript” to “purescript-group-b”. In either case, dependent projects need to update where they source their dependencies from.<p>Namespacing, in my experience, tends to make the forking process slightly “cleaner”, because you avoid having a potentially non-“right” “original” (for example, “purescript” tends to look more legitimate than “purescript-group-b”). But some comments in this thread seem to paint namespacing as a hard requirement, or claim that package managers without namespacing are missing a core, mandatory feature.

hardwaresofton,,,,20552646,[20552658],20552585.0,,"&gt;  I wasn’t implying you claimed that all gems needed a group, I was proposing it as part of the thought experiment. My apologies if that was unclear.<p>My apologies I certainly misread your comment.<p>&gt; To your list of examples: my point parallels your own, I think. I’m saying that given the “right” version is arbitrary and subjective, the difference between “group-b&#x2F;purescript” and “purescript-group-b” is effectively nil. More concretely: if namespacing existed, you could fork “group-a&#x2F;purescript” to “group-b&#x2F;purescript”, but if namespacing didn’t, you could fork “purescript” to “purescript-group-b”. In either case, dependent projects need to update where they source their dependencies from.<p>I agree -- the effects are definitely similar and almost equivalent. However does requiring a group&#x2F;author change things <i>at all</i>? It seems like it could introduce an abstraction lever.<p>&gt; Namespacing, in my experience, tends to make the forking process slightly “cleaner”, because you avoid having a potentially non-“right” “original” (for example, “purescript” tends to look more legitimate than “purescript-group-b”). But some comments in this thread seem to paint namespacing as a hard requirement, or claim that package managers without namespacing are missing a core, mandatory feature. The case I’m presenting is that this isn’t the case: namespacing is a useful feature for several workflows, but adding namespacing doesn’t fundamentally alter the issue.<p>I&#x27;m on the fence -- I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good counter case, but what about the layer of abstraction introduced by the implied&#x2F;required existence of &lt;group&gt;? You could write code that imports &quot;purescript&quot;, but then resolve it later (as some others mentioned, go.mod is or some other modules file that clarifies mappings) to determine <i>which</i> &quot;purescript&quot; that is. You could solve this by &quot;alias&quot;ing &quot;project&#x2F;purescript&quot; to &quot;purescript&quot; (and then having some similar extra configuration that says &quot;purescript&quot; -&gt; &quot;project&#x2F;purescript&quot;, and now I&#x27;m not sure if either is better (so basically having this indirection be a &quot;module resolution feature&quot; or a &quot;module aliasing feature&quot;), and if there&#x27;s any value in forcing one (requiring the existence of &lt;group&gt; would almost certainly force the module resolution thing, but also break builds the second similarly named packages were published...) or if they really are just the same.<p>I also found the page on this by the rust team pretty convincing[0].<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internals.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;crates-io-package-policies&#x2F;1041"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internals.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;crates-io-package-policies...</a>",1564389922,,comment,

A fleet of thousands of planes (especially a &#x27;mature&#x27; design), flying thousands of hours per year, in service for decades should have very few losses due to fundamental design issues.  It would be nice to say it should be &lt;1, but the reality is the stars sometimes align and several weaknesses conspire to make a fatal event.  With MCAS, the 737 Max 8 was already at a rate of 2 events in less than a year with a fleet that was a tiny fraction (&lt;6%) of its ultimate fleet size.<p>Assuming nothing else changed, at full fleet size, that would be over 30 losses a year, or well over 1000 losses over the fleet&#x27;s lifetime.  They misengineered the system by at least 3 orders of magnitude.  This is, at the very least, profound professional and managerial negligence.  I&#x27;m not not yet convinced it&#x27;s not also criminal.  At the very least, all management who touched this subsystem or were part of the no-new-training-at-any-cost push should have already been shown the door up to and including the CEO.<p>And yes, things _are_ being done and they are adding &#x27;nines&#x27; to the reliability as quickly as they can, but again, they are starting from a subsystem that kills everybody on board every 800,000 flight hours or so.<p>They appear to be dishonest with the public (and perhaps themselves) about how much risk is eliminated with each change and, similarly, appear to not be factoring in that some of these changes introduce other risks and failure modes.<p>What we have here is a giant fucking mess and a management organization that fosters no confidence in its ability to navigate itself out of it.  In the end, I do expect Boeing to somehow glue-gun 3 more 9&#x27;s of reliability onto this airframe and stop bleeding valuation, but it won&#x27;t be pretty and it probably won&#x27;t be fast.",1564390537,,comment,

vinceguidry,,,,20552689,[20552761],20552341.0,,"You&#x27;ve left the realm of rationalism and are firmly seated in theology. The correct theological interpretation here isn&#x27;t that God can&#x27;t do something illogical, but rather that God can remain strictly logical, <i>and still be God</i>. God isn&#x27;t constrained by formal logic, but chooses to be because it suits Him. In fact, the entire field of theology is built on this. Theologies are imagined descriptions of God, these imaginations are accepted by God because God wants us to believe in Him.<p>The problem of evil is the same way, ascribing a kind of logic to God. Theologians think a lot about theodicy, and have broken away from their churches over it.<p>One interesting way to think about it is that God has three basic attitudes about the things humans do. God either wills a thing, accepts it, or tolerates it. If God wills it, it creates more goodness in the world than it takes away. If God accepts it, then the balance is roughly equal. If He tolerates it, then that means God has to balance the scales personally. This can happen through the mechanism we call karma.<p>A rationally-aware theologian would state that God accepts any rational regime you want to put on him, and the Book of Job puts this into story form. Just because God is rational and good doesn&#x27;t mean He&#x27;s going to appear that way all the time to all the people.",1564390629,,comment,

Luckily she didn&#x27;t jump at low tide when she could have broken her legs or ended up crippled for life. As it happened she ended up in the mental health ward.

They have a well-defined set of tasks, small enough to fit in your head.<p>People usually insist that software should be modular, so that you don&#x27;t have to have millions of lines of code in your head when making a local change. That&#x27;s what drove the procedural evolution and later the OOP evolution.<p>So if you&#x27;re a good boy&#x2F;girl&#x2F;etc. you write your million-LOCs PC application as modules that are manageable for (ideally) a single person. Then you need an extra programmer to glue the modules together.<p>&gt; This means that you have a certain trouble sharing the code with your colleagues, making the bus factor of your project closer to 1, and lowering the usefulness of code reviews.<p>Where does Forth prohibit peer reviews and pair programming? If you have a bus factor of 1, it is because you don&#x27;t want to pay the price of increasing it. It has nothing to do with Forth; plenty of projects in super-high hyper-readable projects have a bus factor of 1.<p>&gt; This means that you have trouble sharing code with yourself in your next project.<p>Not really. It&#x27;s easier to copy&#x2F;paste&#x2F;hack Forth code. The code is more compact for various reasons: point-free style makes it less verbose, you tend to factor more intensively and you code exactly what you need.<p>&gt; You become tightly coupled do the machine. This is, on one hand, liberating, you can do anything easily. But this is also limiting, because you spend your mental resources on optimizing for this particular machine.<p>No, that&#x27;s the other way. When you code e.g. for a little-endian, two&#x27;s complement CPU then you don&#x27;t have to worry about big-endian and sign magnitude. You are actually <i>also</i> optimizing programmer&#x27;s cycles too.<p>Being tightly coupled to the machine is what embedded programming really is about.

genuineDSD,,,,20552945,,20549685.0,,"Uhm, I have grown up with Macintoshs and I still use them. So, my comment has at least double the emotional intensity compared to the author&#x27;s. ;-) In all seriousness, I say this because it is clear that his post is mostly based on an emotional attachment to a tool, not on critical thinking.<p>Maybe I misunderstood, but if I understood him correctly, the premise is that Hypercard would still be around if it did not collide with Steve&#x27;s vision of a world of dumb users and smart engineers. This is wrong on so many levels, I don&#x27;t even know where to start. Are you willing to learn?<p>First, Hypercard was created when 13&quot; 256-color displays were state of the art (actually even earlier) and there were exactly two devices to interact with your Macintosh: a keyboard and a mouse. So, for simple tasks, it was quite easy to create a tool that would allow you to stick together a simple program using clicks and a verbose scripting language. Nowadays, however, general purpose applications are supposed to work on a variety of devices, from 4&quot; phones with touchscreens to desktop-Macs supporting 27&quot;+ screens being used with traditional keyboards and mice. Maybe this will change in the future, but if you want to precisely describe a structure (GUI-compontents) in a generalized fashion, a textual representation (e.g. react-components), so far, is just superior to any GUI-tool that is around.<p>When hypercard was created, VCS (such as git, svn, etc.) weren&#x27;t really a thing. Most software was developed in about the same way as you created Hypercard projects: You made changes to your main copy and that&#x27;s that. Today, you don&#x27;t even think about starting a software project without having vcs in place. Similarly, when Hypercard was created, many software methodologies weren&#x27;t a thing: Unit Testing, Integration testing, etc.<p>Now, I am a software engineer, and while I never wrote Hypercard applications myself, I once found myself maintaining an Filemaker-Application. Filemaker, I reckon, is very similar to Hypercard in that you plug together your app using a GUI and some overly verbose, pseudo-simple scripting language. And, needless to say, this was an absolute disaster: In the beginning, it was a simple tool that automated a couple of tasks and it was created in a very short period of time, thanks to the easy-of-use of Filemaker. However, as with all other tools, it grew in complexity. Now, ever tried to track changes in the source code using Filemaker-files? Ever tried to unit test Filemaker-code?<p>And don&#x27;t get me started with the absolute ludicrous idea to use programming languages that resemble a natural language. Claiming that this is as effective as using an abstract language is akin to describing complex mathematical facts using only a natural language—while possible, it is completely unfeasible.",1564393850,,comment,

Wa9neYa0,True,,,20552990,,,1.0,"Hi:)<p>I was a postgraduate student in IT security and am about to work as a security engineer in a company. And I&#x27;m considering ... a long term plan (like 5-7 years, not sure) to get a series of certifications in the security industry. The reason for the plan is not for a higher salary or being better-recognized (but who hates them?). The main consideration is to find something that keeps me learning things systematically (I presume leaning stuff in the working is fragmented?), that keeps me sharp. I enjoy the process of learning and it doesn&#x27;t hurt if it gives me something in return.<p>So I&#x27;m looking into different types of certifications. I did some researches and currently consider these certifications: CompTIA Security+, Pentest+, CEH, CASP, CISSP. And my personal preferences are:<p>1. I&#x27;m not really into management. Technology thrills me.<p>2. Certs don&#x27;t have to be so recognized as long as it teaches something and interesting.<p>3. The year doesn&#x27;t matter. It can take 10 years if necessary.<p>So my questions are:):<p>1. Are these listed enough? Any more recommendations? And if I have to switch to the management position in the future, what is the baseline certification?<p>2. Could somebody please help to ... sort of &quot;design&quot; a general pathway (not based on my case. I hope it helps others as well) based on the easiness or the interesting level? like &quot;take A because it&#x27;s usually the start, X years later you can take B, or you can take C if you want challenges&quot; something like that. I know it&#x27;s kinda rude but if we do research for tons of certifications out there, the result wouldn&#x27;t be necessarily good.<p>3. I notice most of certs are valid for 3-4 years. And there&#x27;s a renew price. What does that mean? I pay the price and don&#x27;t have to take the exam again?<p>Thanks for anyone replying. I&#x27;d be better if you did actually take part in one or some of them:) Cheers",1564394459,Ask HN: Best pathway for security certifications in career?,story,

Maybe not making toast, but cooking, ironing, heating, cooling, watching TV etc. I&#x27;m not sure you can rely on any excess energy being available for storage if you&#x27;re not connected to the grid.<p>&gt;The idea behind individual solar energy is not consuming it real time but associating it with a storage solution to allow bigger throughput.<p>If that&#x27;s the idea then you are exposing a major issue with solar. Namely: in order to rely solely on solar (+battery), you need a solar deployment that covers your energy needs now + energy to charge battery for when the sun isn&#x27;t shining (taking into account the associated loss of storing and retrieving power from battery). This means that you need to oversubscribe&#x2F;over capitalize solar to charge up the battery (which then lowers your total efficiency) in order to bridge daily and seasonal variability in solar output. This means that you need generation capacity that probably exceeds the surface area available to what a typical house or apartment can provide and explodes your costs.<p>This has major implications for large scale solar+battery deployments because at that scale, there is no grid to fall back on (which is why solar ALWAYS needs reliable backup generation - which is typically gas or biofuels). This is why solar+battery is never going to be cost-effective because you&#x27;re always going to be forced to over-build infrastructure that will sit idly doing nothing most of the time.<p>This doesn&#x27;t even touch on the fact that there is no actual battery technology that keep enough load to power a modern city overnight, much less to bridge seasonal variability at that scale (where the battery would be expected to keep enough energy for weeks at a time).",1564396707,,comment,

All we can do is reduce the impact.<p>It&#x27;s clear from the article&#x27;s text that the statement was <i>not</i> that the predicted problems would occur by 2000, since &quot;UNEP is working toward forming a scientific plan of action by the end of 1990&quot; would give an absurdly short timeline.<p>It says &quot;The most conservative scientific estimate that the Earth’s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years, said Brown.&quot;<p>Conveniently, that was 30 years ago. I went to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climate.nasa.gov&#x2F;vital-signs&#x2F;global-temperature&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climate.nasa.gov&#x2F;vital-signs&#x2F;global-temperature&#x2F;</a> . In 1989 the temperature anomaly was about +0.25°C. It&#x27;s currently +0.82°C. A change of 0.57°C is just over 1°F. As predicted by the most conservative estimate.<p>I have been unable to find the report. The only people who talk about that newspaper article appear to be climate change denialists, who don&#x27;t link to the actual report, and misread the article to believe that there&#x27;s a prediction of a 3 foot sea rise by 2000.<p>The late 1980s is when the majority of scientists - and associated people like Isaac Asimov, at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QfB7Hzb7G2Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QfB7Hzb7G2Q</a> - were convinced of the evidence of global warming and its potential problems.<p>That built upon earlier work. Eg, &quot;In 1982, Exxon&#x27;s environmental affairs office circulated an internal report to Exxon&#x27;s management which said that the consequences of climate change could be catastrophic, and that a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption would be necessary to curtail future climate change.

derefr,,,,20553155,[20553223],20552975.0,,"I agree that it’d be a cool hack to be able to somehow reuse all the existing BitTorrent software and network to sync up arbitrary pieces of files that people just-to-happen to have. I’ve been thinking about this for a while, but I haven’t come up with any good solutions.<p>The main problems are that:<p>1. torrents have different “piece sizes” (i.e. the torrent creator chooses a power-of-two size for the <i>partitions</i> of the torrent’s data that get their hashes stored in the torrent file); and<p>2. multi-file torrents produce “pieces” that are an arbitrary split of the concatenation of their files, as if they were actually a torrent of an archive file—just a virtual one synthesized on the spot by the torrent client, as if it was using FUSE to translate the filesystem it sees into a packfile to share.<p>The “solution” to problem #1, if you can call it that, is to walk your files and generate (log N) different torrents per file, for each piece size. Then—at least for single-file  torrents—you <i>could</i> in theory build a tracker (and client-API-hooked search engine) that exposes “virtual torrents” for every possible combination of pieces (when fed this sort of... torrent-data overlapped Merkle tree.)<p>I don’t think there’s really a more clever solution to problem #2 than the one torrents already use, though. It really does make sense to pack files together into single large pieces, when files are small and numerous, because the metadata of sharing a single file on the network (or, to a lesser extent, of storing a single file separately on disk) has overhead, and so people don’t tend to like <i>seeding</i> tons of tiny files, preferring to instead seed archives of them. (Or, even worse, when a file is seen by most as useless except in the context of being a “resource file” of a particular application, people will only ever bother to seed it in the form of the installation archive of said application.)<p>To find a particular tiny file on the network, then, you need an index mapping the metadata (and&#x2F;or hash) of the file you want, to the metadata <i>and</i> hash of an archive&#x2F;packfile that contains it, and which <i>is</i> tracked by the network. Which is... the thing torrent search engines—usually built on the backs of torrent trackers—give us: the ability to plug in a filename, and find torrents that list that name in their manifests.<p>(IPFS doesn’t solve problem #2 either, if you’re curious. It just keeps everything as individual file hashes, and then allows you to retrieve directory manifests by <i>their</i> hashes—but you can’t predict a directory manifest hash <i>from</i> a file hash, in order to discover the directories that “make use of” a given file, and might therefore have a more-well-pinned packfile equivalent representation that includes that file.)<p>I think we could solve #2 if we had some sort of system of hashing—not necessarily <i>cryptographic</i> hashing—that enabled us to ask, in O(1) time, “given that the hash of a packfile of bytes of size Xsz is Xh, does the packfile contain a file whose size is Ysz≤Xsz but otherwise arbitrary, and whose hash is Yh; and if so, at what range within the packfile can we find the file?” (The “but otherwise arbitrary” part is important; we can’t just pre-chunk up the packfile and hash all possible chunks of it, like we can with #1, since the files in it might be in any arbitrary positions with any arbitrary lengths, potentially even straddling a piece boundary.)<p>If we had such a hash algorithm, then any file hash of this type that a tracker received in a request could be used as, essentially, a zero-knowledge proof of what packfiles contain that file (since you can just iterate all the packfiles you have and check whether they contain it, and use that to build an <i>inverted index</i> from segment hashes to packfile hashes.) But I don’t think a hashing scheme like this currently exists. (At least, <i>in this use-case</i>... YouTube’s ContentID algorithm is kind of an implementation of this for audio fingerprinting. Or maybe not; maybe it’s just pre-generating comparator fingerprints for every possible slice of each claimed audio track!)",1564396976,,comment,

The Model 3 has cheaper door handles than the Model S.<p>Tesla is about building car factories rather than cars. Once you have the robots doing as they are told then you can make whatever you want.<p>If you had to recycle a Lamborghini and a Dacia Sandero then you would probably end up with near equal piles of raw materials for both vehicles, give or take a bit of steel.<p>The other input is energy. The cylinder head on the Lamborghini takes a bit more work to make than the lump of iron that comes with the Dacia. But, if you have built out lots of renewable power then you can get those CNC machines and other robots doing overtime.<p>Tesla with their vertical integration business model are finding customers at their price point and they can&#x27;t make cars quick enough. Despite the sceptics, it is working.<p>Personally I think the budget space will be filled with an electric version of a &#x27;Dacia Sandero&#x27; but made in China. EVs are more pleasant to be in as there is not the vibration and noise from the engine, or the local cloud of pollution.<p>Because of this and the realities of driving in city&#x2F;town areas there really is a need for a vehicle far simpler than a Model 3, something without the bells and whistles. Honda have something in the works that is nearer the brief. They are going with a low range EV that is not going to pretend to do hundreds of miles on a charge. This is for the two car family where car two just needs to do the shopping, pick the kids up and get into congestion charging zones. In China there are plenty of BYD fit for purpose EVs that are budget and will be making their way to Western markets in due course.<p>The legacy brands in Europe and the USA are stuck with having to do things the old way with existing supply chains.

We have so many people who could be working to fix these problems stuck in offices doing stuff that there isn&#x27;t really a need for (i.e. most all software development) because that&#x27;s what the &#x27;market&#x27; rewards. We need to completely overhaul what we think of as value and how we reward it. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible under the current capitalist system and I don&#x27;t see the majority of people supporting alternative systems.<p>Imagine if we deployed the people power and innovation that currently gets wasted in competition between rival social media applications and redirected it to doing something about climate change. It&#x27;s not possible for individuals to make that change however because at the end of the day they need to pay their landlord (who I regard as largely parasitic leeches on productivity) and buy food at the shops; and the roles that would allow them to contribute to this don&#x27;t exist in the number, or at the wages, required.<p>The cost of moving to zero emissions here in the UK was estimated as being £1 trillion so it was kind of kicked down the road to maybe slightly after 2050. Which is just mad. Sure China and India might be bigger emitters but someone has to make the first move. The innovations can then be shared for free with those countries, we can spend money to help them transition. This is our long term survival, we need to be less squeamish about taking what we need from &quot;private property&quot; (read tax havens, the stock market, etc). But clearly these changes aren&#x27;t achievable at the speed and scale needed solely through voting. Democracies tend to limit themselves to a small range of acceptable views around a midpoint and take a long time to change even if there is a moral imperative, like the previous changes you mention; so I don&#x27;t see how they can react at the speed necessary to fix this.<p>In addition addressing climate change without addressing social justice won&#x27;t work. As the article mentions the people most affected by this are going to overwhelmingly be poor and in less-developed countries.

cjblomqvist,,,,20553466,,20552387.0,,"This feels a little unwarranted (almost rude?) and without considering the differences. So let&#x27;s do some proper analysis of your statement and comparison of the car market and the phone market.<p>1. Smartphones provided a new type of utility and a very significant leap of value to the user (I bet most people  do other stuff than calling for the vast majority of time spent with their phones, which was not the case with feature phones or generally before the iPhone). Electric cars provide a minor difference in new utility and probably also value. It&#x27;s more a difference in the means rather than a difference of the end result.<p>2. Phones are significantly cheaper than cars. Thus, there&#x27;s a much larger market unit wise than cars (there are probably a similar number of units in use at any point in time, but cars don&#x27;t get thrown away after 2 years...)<p>Apple did something similar which is pretty well known in disruption theory. They moved up the market and became a truly premium phone company. That&#x27;s also why they have a quite small portion of the market unit wise (less than 10%?). They are actually not dominating the industry, they are a niche player (but very successful at that, as seen profit wise, especially compared to their competitors). They are also really good at being a premium phone maker, and have leveraged a lot of other core competencies (look up on Wikipedia for more about that concept) well such as their software competencies and their ecosystem thinking (locking their users into their ecosystem and providing most key parts of that ecosystem).<p>So what about Tesla? They are hardly as good as Apple premium wise. The market for premium is also a lot smaller for cars, especially if you move upwards from where Tesla is right now. It&#x27;s also very hard to make a profit in that market, and most make a profit by combining a mass scale operation (more or less all premium car brands are owned by one of the big car companies). So is (more) premium a great direction for Tesla? I doubt it. It will hinder economies of scale which have proven difficult to  not have.<p>So, unless Tesla partner up, don&#x27;t believe electric car engines&#x2F;drive trains will become commoditized in the near future and&#x2F;or have some significant premium&#x2F;lock-in&#x2F;ecosystem stuff up their sleeve, it looks like budget is the way to go... They might stay in the premium but not luxury segment, but it&#x27;s cut throat with lots of competition. To me that sounds like a lost opportunity and waste of some significant base innovation.<p>And... I guess above is why Tesla seems to desperately try to find additional competitive barriers; self driving, fully automated manufacturing, quick charge network, etc. But, they are long shots so far. It&#x27;s difficult to innovate one area, very much so multiple areas simultaneously.",1564400602,,comment,

Others interpret that as being &#x27;soft on terrorism&#x27;, and we just need to &#x27;bomb them into oblivion&#x27;; whereas I fear that while actual physical fighting is definitely a critical part of the overall campaign, there&#x27;s a tremendous danger it&#x27;ll just create more terrorists because we haven&#x27;t eradicated the actual root source.<p>To me, striving to understanding an enemy doesn&#x27;t prevent direct, firm action, <i>if</i> that is then convincingly found to be the most effective and efficient way of fighting them. In turn, I feel understanding your enemy prevents random, ineffective, emotionally-satisfying but results-lacking action. Others, of course, will disagree.<p>So - to the point of the article and discussion: I agree with op, if that is their intention, that you have to look at incentives; I&#x27;ve worked in corporate world for decades and I fully agree that you can have whatever value pledges, official goals, mission statements, and even official rules you darn well want to; and they&#x27;re completely irrelevant if actual incentives, when summed out, reward a different behaviour. External and internal rules, and power, and statements, and goals, are all factors in incentives; as are the more subtle, emergent incentives.

I discovered a lot about unknown rock bands just by looking at files shared by other people and asking them for more information. Those were the early days of multiuser downloads, when downloading a not so famous movie could take like two months (it happened to me) so pestering the poor user on the other side with continuous downloads wasn&#x27;t an option.  
Being able to chat also gave the users the opportunity to help each other to solve networking problems or other technical issues.

This is potentially justifiable in an academic setting where stream-of-consciousness type programming is acceptable for a barebones proof of concept, but attempting to work with 1000+ LOC functions with non-descriptive variable names etc. is not only not acceptable in modern software, it is ungracious to your coworkers.<p>Unfortunately this can sometimes be coupled with a good dose of hubris (&quot;I have a PhD and you don&#x27;t!&quot;), and efforts to provide constructive criticism are often met with anger&#x2F;apathy&#x2F;belittling&#x2F;ignorance.

Taxing X—assuming the tax levied is an appropriate amount to cover the externalities of X—makes actor Y who is doing X pay for X and its externalities, alleviating the burden on the public while avoiding taking an actual stand and&#x2F;or engaging an effort to reduce X. Y does X? Y pays for it, not the public.<p>How much taxes on X adds to public revenue is mostly irrelevant, so long as it is enough to cover the costs of dealing with X without shifting that burden onto the general public via <i>other</i> taxes. If the revenue from X is enough to cover the costs of X’s externalities <i>and</i> also pays for wages and&#x2F;or other public needs, that’s a net win for the public. You likely won’t see a city starting up a campaign to increase undesirable thing X just because it’d increase revenues.<p>Now, if the public really wants to <i>reduce</i> X by means of taxing X, it will likely choose to levy heavy, punitive taxes on X as doing X increases&#x2F;continues, hoping to make it financially painful to those doing X to have to pay for X—for example, look at cigarette taxes. That can only go so far, though, before you encounter those for whom the added punitive tax is not a sufficient deterrent. Then it’s either a choice between more increases to get X to zero, or some other type of concerted public or legal effort to curtail X.<p>The act of taxing X isn’t enough of a signal to conclude the public is using the tax as a <i>reduction</i> effort. But it’s certainly a signal that the public doesn’t want to pay for X via standard revenues—and the public absolutely should not bear the burden for the negative externalities of any X. There’s no doubt a built-in hope that, assuming the costs of X’s externalities are known, taxing Y to pay for X will encourage reduction because—especially if Y is a company—Y wants to keep their expenses low, and really doesn’t want to pay for X. A city levying such taxes, assuming it is even moderately well-managed, will hope to see that the tax revenue for X will hit zero in tandem with X itself hitting zero—the success state[0].<p>[0]: I’m going to ignore the real-world chance that revenues from X get allocated to previously non-existing programs that then need to find a new source of revenue—but that’s a different problem.",1564402336,,comment,

Besides, everybody knows that Boeing is in Seattle.</i><p>[...]<p>&gt; <i>Now that Condit has pulled the ripcord on yet another bad relationship, the &quot;reverse takeover&quot; theorists seem prophetic: Harry Stonecipher, 67, is Boeing&#x27;s CEO.

If it gets the go-ahead, the $7 billion project might restore some of Boeing&#x27;s once-famed esprit de corps--maybe even enough to lure its severed head back to Seattle.

A practical way to identify an ultra-processed product is to check to see if its list of ingredients contains at least one item characteristic of the NOVA ultra-processed food group, which is to say, either food substances never or rarely used in kitchens (such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated or interesterified oils, and hydrolysed proteins), or classes of additives designed to make the final product palatable or more appealing (such as flavours, flavour enhancers, colours, emulsifiers, emulsifying salts, sweeteners, thickeners, and anti-foaming, bulking, carbonating, foaming, gelling and glazing agents).&quot;",1564402515,,comment,

Even ignoring what I wrote above, from the standpoint of God &quot;a God that can do two things&quot; might not be greater than a &quot;God that can only do one&quot;.<p>God himself defines not just physical laws and logic, but also the very meaning of notions like &quot;greater&quot; (that is, works on a meta level). &quot;More if greater&quot; is our undestanding of what&#x27;s greater, not necessarily God&#x27;s (like a child thinks more sugar in food is greater, but a parent knows better).

The difference is that the optical energy is not directly generated by the Sun, but instead by a material at high temperature (termed the emitter), that causes it to emit light.

Why do they have the upper hand? Because of their technological advantages and resources. Since you are an ignorant, you&#x27;d probably say, of course, US is advanced and they do good and bad with it. Of course, but then read a bit more and you arrive at one of the very dark corners of history, slavery.

For <i>that being consider as slavery</i>, there would be only potential jurisdictions, no? International and&#x2F;or their own. If it were International, the US would face sanctions.

However, if Trump was not as blunt about the whole situation and would have approached it differently, both EU and US probably dismantle the deal and escalate everything easily. Why? Because EU would have been convinced&#x2F;forced, by a rather more rational US president, to get out of the deal.

Think about what it would cost to set up a plug. It might be quite a bit, but unless electricity is really far away, it&#x27;s not a crazy amount either.<p>If buying an EV would save you a significant amount of money over a 10 year period, it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;d be willing to use some of that savings to pay to have a plug set up. Maybe you can&#x27;t set up that plug yourself, but as long as you&#x27;re willing to pay a bit extra over the cost of electricity, there&#x27;s going to be companies willing to set up plugs along the street. Once investors see that the transition to EVs is guaranteed, I&#x27;m certain there will be a rush to put up chargers, since the company that gets a street is likely to keep a monopoly on that street for a long time.<p>The other way to get street side charging is simply to get governments to do it. That&#x27;s what Oslo has done. They started out being free, but now there&#x27;s a reasonable fee on them, and I think that&#x27;s much more sustainable. With some luck in the elections I could see something like that happening in several areas of the US. It&#x27;ll be much easier to sell this policy once EVs are a bit cheaper, so I think it&#x27;s possible if democrats gain some control, especially if they gain some support for some kind of Green New Deal. It&#x27;s a great investment to boost the economy long term. Generates lots of decent work in the short term, and massive benefits to the public in the long term since it&#x27;ll guarantee them cheap charging, leading to big savings to operate their vehicles.<p>There&#x27;s another way to think about it: setting up a plug for your car is a very tiny fraction of the work&#x2F;infrastructure required for your apartment, which somehow you found the way to pay for (either directly, or through renting). This kind of work is relatively easy to finance if the demand is there, since it&#x27;s an investment that&#x27;s likely to last a very long time and generate a lot of value.<p>There&#x27;s also the fast charging model, which can be OK if you have a car with a fairly large battery and don&#x27;t drive too much. You might be able to get by with charging once a week, and you could probably do it at a location where you&#x27;d spend some time anyway, such as a supermarket, near a restaurant or exercise studio.

I suspect if I looked for one that does I might find it and it might have a slightly lower rate.  Maybe.

short_sells_poo,,,,20553915,,20553001.0,,"&gt; Doing innovation comes with risks - which may or may not pan out. If it doesn&#x27;t pan out, the executives would get chewed for it, and if it does pan out it is unlikely to pay off for a long time (in terms of bonuses - at least, not within their tenure).<p>You really nailed the problem. It is faced by all companies with sizeable middle management (read, all companies above a certain size).<p>Let&#x27;s look at the incentives. A middle manager with an entrepreneurial spirit who tries to enact change, try new ideas and stay ahead of the curve has a chance to make it to the top, provided they have allies already at the top who are also willing to bet their reputation on the underling and also that none of the bets backfire badly.<p>On the other hand, let&#x27;s take a pointy haired boss type middle manager who does jack-all, avoids responsibility where possible and therefore by definition they also don&#x27;t participitate in any cockups. They sort of coast by, being too average to notice either for outperformance or underperformance. After 20 years at the company, they retire.<p>Which of these two are going to be the majority? In my experience, the latter outweighs the former by a large margin. Being in the latter, you don&#x27;t have to do anything, just stay away from trouble. Squash any ambitious projects your group comes up with, maintain some token efforts that look good on quarterly presentations, but keep it all fairly toothless.<p>Over time they get entrenched in the company and whether consciously or not, they ensure that only similarly minded people are promoted to middle management, since anyone more ambitious is a direct threat. None of these people are individually evil, and they perhaps aren&#x27;t even consciously impeding the company. They become a product of the environment.

Generally you pay via cashiers check or wire transfer (rarely via personal check, but with a waiting period most of the time then). Saying “paying cash” at a dealership means “not financing the vehicle.”<p>I’m not saying it’s not possible to use paper currency, I’ve done it myself. For anything of value though, you’ll generally get a less enthused recipient (as they’ll have hassles depositing it), not to mention the hassle you’ll get just to withdraw the money. As an example in the US, withdrawing over $10k in cash requires filling out paperwork. Withdrawing much larger amounts will generally involve even more scrutiny. Trying to break up the withdrawals to stay under $10k will very likely set off red flags with the bank and lead to inquiries from their compliance department at best (usually much worse).",1564404027,,comment,

By their criteria, it appears as though homemade breads and ice cream would qualify as ultra processed even though they use fairly basic ingredients that are combined in very conventional ways.<p>Yet their point is still valid.  I recall a doctor talking about how unhealthy yogurt is due to its sugar content.  If your a person like myself, who either makes their own yogurt or carefully selects brands of plain yogurt, the broad generalization is nonsensical.  If you look at what&#x27;s available on the store shelves, then over 90% of what they have is based on sugary flavoring.  I suspect people buy yogurt since they are usually told that it&#x27;s healthy, but usually end up reaching for the stuff that this study describes as ultra processes because that&#x27;s the stuff that industry invests a lot of effort into making desirable (either through its formulation or advertising).<p>I suspect that there are a number of factors that are contributing to this pseudoscience based health-craze:<p>- It is easier to demonize food products based upon an overgeneralized label than it is to tell people to check the nutrition labels.<p>- Most grocery stores dedicate most of their shelves to food with dubious nutritional value, may that be because the food is formulated to sell (which typically has high sodium or sugar content) or longer shelf life.<p>- Most grocery stores are a poor option for the health conscious because of manipulative sales tactics.  This ranges from the store layout, placement of particular products, and over generalized as well as likely misrepresenting of products as healthy.<p>- A segment of the population feels like they are loosing control over dietary options.  Some areas are surrounded by food sold by places convenience&#x2F;dollar stores and restaurants, yet grocery stores that would support traditional home cooking are more difficult to access.<p>When some people are faced with something that does not reflect their dietary values, or worse, does not meet their medical needs, is it surprising that they would start adopting extreme viewpoints?",1564404199,,comment,

The 3 big issues that I think prevents us solving it are<p>1. Tragedy of the commons<p>When a country&#x2F;company wants to make money by damaging the environment in the process, the money come to the country&#x2F;company now, but the damage is spread world-wide. If the pollution would stay only in that country&#x2F;city, it would be different. So, the choice is natural, especially considering government 4-year terms.<p>2. We always put ourselves first, rest of the city&#x2F;country much further, and rest of the world... doesn&#x27;t matter. What people want, by human nature, is to satisfy their own needs &amp; comfort.<p>Examples:<p>* Why wait for a bus or use an electric bike when one can just drive a 2 tonnes car to move oneself? It&#x27;s comfortable and cheap.<p>* USA-specific, but spreading to other countries as well: people huge SUV-style cars to transport 1-2 persons, when a small one could do the job as well.<p>* Norway refuses to drill for billions of barrels of oil in Arctic, leaving ‘whole industry surprised and disappointed’. Government made the right choice, but a few (prosperous already) affected by making less money complain: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;environment&#x2F;norway-oil-drilling-arctic-ban-labor-party-unions-a8861171.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;environment&#x2F;norway-oil-drillin...</a><p>* France introduces a diesel tax, to reduce pollution, which affects everybody&#x27;s health. But, wait, some need to pay a little more? Let&#x27;s protest! Tax was cancelled: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citylab.com&#x2F;transportation&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;french-protests-gilets-jaunes-emmanuel-macron-gas-diesel-tax&#x2F;576196&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citylab.com&#x2F;transportation&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;french-protes...</a><p>* The Bełchatów Coal mine &amp; Power station in Poland. Hundreds of people employed there, they are happy with it. Should the plant be closed to stop pollution? What about our jobs? No way! And no, getting only 20% of salary for free (basic income) and having to learn stuff to maybe find a new job in renewables is not acceptable. So, the coal plant goes on, but it&#x27;s easier to point to China for doing the same (with more plants, of course).<p>3. Delayed effects of current actions<p>The environment effects of what a one person&#x2F;community&#x2F;country does, bad or good, are hard to see in the short term. Only the downsides are clearly visible in the present. So, taking the correct action is quite hard.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see how to overcome these.

However because the observational API provides &quot;important functionality for which there is no alternative&quot; (to their tracking business), it will not be deprecated. But the content blocking API which also provides important functionality for which there is no alternative (but hinders their advertising business) is being deprecated.<p>Furthermore here you can see a tweet from Justin Schuh, lead of security and privacy on Google Chrome, where he claims that the &quot;sole motivation is correcting privacy and security deficiencies&quot; (which I just debunked as being a possibility), not performance: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;justinschuh&#x2F;status&#x2F;1134092257190064128"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;justinschuh&#x2F;status&#x2F;1134092257190064128</a><p>So between Justin Schuh and Simeon Vincent (author of the post you linked), who is lying?

They give some explanation of what is technically required to implement each approach, and certainly the declarative API is a simpler approach, but you made that point already. And I responded to it.

rauhl,,,,20554209,,20546906.0,,"I would suggest that you look into Common Lisp (no surprise to anyone who knows me …).  Why?<p>Well, it’s <i>solid</i>.  I spent some years as a professional Python programmer, and it was annoying how things which were easy to do in Lisp were difficult or impossible to do in Python (e.g. change a file, reload it and have existing objects updated with the new definitions).  Common Lisp offers all the hooks you might want to be able to mutate a system at runtime, but if you don’t want to, then you can just ignore them.  I find this very graceful: standardise the possibility, but don’t mandate that one think about stuff one doesn’t need to (yet).<p>Another aspect of its solidity is how well the standard (ca. 1994) has stood the test of time.  There are numerous implementations out there, and they all support the same language (modulo some small bugs, no doubt).  Common Lisp code tends to be very portable, and tends to be easy to customise for different implementations and platforms when necessary (the way that <i>FEATURES</i> interacts with conditional reading of source is great).  Libraries from twenty years ago still just work.  That’s almost unheard of in any other language I’ve used.<p>Yet another aspect of its solidity is its error-handling capabilities, unmatched in any other language I’ve used.  Its condition system offers code the ability to signal exceptional and non-exceptional conditions (specifically, errors, warnings and signals), to catch such conditions, to offer recovery strategies for such conditions and finally to choose between recovery strategies for such conditions — to include prompting for human input if desired.  It is an amazingly powerful faculty.  But like the ability to handle runtime redefinitions, you don’t need to use it at all if you don’t want to.<p>It’s high-performance, too, getting within an order of magnitude of the performance of C.<p>This all means that Common Lisp can be used for quick hacks, simple scripts and all the way up to long-running production systems.<p>To get started with Common Lisp you’ll want to take a look at Quicklisp, which is the community-standard compilation of free software libraries.  It hooks into all the common implementations and offers a plethora of packages.<p>If you’re willing to use emacs (which I also suggest), then SLIME is very good, but the commercial implementations also have their own excellent IDEs which you might find you prefer.<p>I’ll be the first to admit that Common Lisp has some flaws, too — I would <i>love</i> to see a modern standard which specifies case-preservation as the default, standardises threads (or something like Go’s channels and goroutines …) and updates the pathname portion of the spec; I’d love to see something which works out a few of the historical bits (like weird argument orders in a few cases).  But that stuff is <i>mostly</i> just nitpicking, like complaining that the breaks on a Lamborghini are the wrong colour.",1564405773,,comment,

I recently needed to convert raw OCR files to PDF -- place TIFs on each page without recompressing, place invisible text on top, add bookmarks, save. I ended up stringing together three python libraries (img2pdf for efficient image combining, reportlab to place text, PyPDF2 to merge the two), which was both clunky and slow. Second pass was scripting command line tools (tiffcp + tiff2pdf + reportlab + pdftk), which was still clunky but at least faster.<p>It would be awesome if there was one solid, fast implementation that lots of language ecosystems could wrap and contribute back to. I haven&#x27;t looked around much outside of Python -- maybe that&#x27;s OpenPDF with Graal, or PDFium, or something else mentioned in the sibling comments? But there are so many usecases for PDF, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find that those also fail to cover the whole field.<p>Y&#x27;know what I can imagine working is a package ecosystem that uses a common in-memory data structure, so you have one base package that does the reading and writing and low-level manipulation, and someone else can come along and write the equivalent of img2pdf or reportlab as separate packages that compose without any efficiency loss. That could work in any language but it feels like the kind of thing Rust is doing really well these days.

It&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to suggest that any country could replicate its success without that enormous geographical advantage.<p>Current renewable technology is very vulnerable to certain kinds of interruption. In the case of a bad storm, for example, wind turbines have to be shut off (as happened in Denmark in 2005) to avoid damage and the sky is likely to be too overcast for significant solar generation, so a country using 100% intermittent renewables faces blackouts unless they&#x27;ve invested trillions of dollars in multiple days of battery capacity (for my country, the UK, 48 hours of battery capacity at current prices works out to be 2.58 trillion USD).<p>The alternative to battery backup for wind+solar is to have natural gas plants on-site to fill in demand, but even when they&#x27;re rarely used they leak so much methane that much of the relative CO2 savings from the renewables they&#x27;re backing are wiped out.<p>Nuclear (fission) energy has lots of ugly flaws, and if it does rescue us from the climate crisis it won&#x27;t be in the form of monolithic one-off generating stations, but I think going all on on wind and solar is a huge mistake.
