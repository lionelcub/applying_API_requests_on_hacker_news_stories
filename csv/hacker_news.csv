I absolutely didn&#x27;t find that fun. It is something I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy at all. I communicate well during meetings, and I work well with my team to solve the tasks at hand.<p>But when almost all of the top tech companies have such supposedly <i>fun</i> activities for team bonding, or other reasons, I think it alienates people like me who are good engineers but don&#x27;t enjoy such activities.<p>Another comment on that post, is relieving and shares similar opinion of mine:<p>&gt; For any software engineer truly suited to their job, the work required should already be &quot;fun&quot;, <i>in and of itself</i>.  If not, then said engineer is in the wrong line of work and should find something they <i>would</i> enjoy doing every day for the rest of their career. 
For many, being forced to endure such irrelevant social engagement is an uncomfortable disincentive they would do anything to avoid.  &quot;Community&quot; isn&#x27;t something you can <i>impose</i>, it can only be &quot;nurtured&quot;!  It develops organically, not from what you <i>think</i> would be &quot;fun&quot; but what those on your team <i>actually enjoy</i>.  You learn this by observing and paying attention.  Then, when you learn what works, you simply do <i>more</i> of it. 
Follow through on this idea of imposing &quot;fun&quot; at work and you risk alienating all your best engineers.<p>Considering how STEM fields naturally attract introverts, shouldn&#x27;t managers at companies avoid or at least make their supposedly fun activities not mandatory?

If not, then said engineer is in the wrong line of work and should find something they <i>would</i> enjoy doing every day for the rest of their career.

Then, when you learn what works, you simply do <i>more</i> of it. 
Follow through on this idea of imposing &quot;fun&quot; at work and you risk alienating all your best engineers.<p>Considering how STEM fields naturally attract introverts, shouldn&#x27;t managers at companies avoid or at least make their supposedly fun activities not mandatory?
